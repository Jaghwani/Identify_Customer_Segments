## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. There are a number of datasets are used in the project but I have REMOVED the files from my computer via the agreement with Arvato Bartlesmann after completing the project, so the project only code with many of assessment, cleaning steps, and making decisions on data.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is hands-on experience with a real-life task on identify customer segments that makes use of these techniques, focusing on the unsupervised work that goes into understanding a dataset.

I have implemented in this project a lot of cleaning steps before applying machine learning methods. This project show the ability to perform data wrangling and the ability to make decisions on data that I work with.

Steps used this notebook are:

Step 1: Preprocessing

Dealing with missing or unknown values.
Considering the level of measurement for each feature in the dataset (e.g. categorical, ordinal, numeric).

Step 2: Feature Transformation

Feature scaling. 
Principal component analysis. 

Step 3: Clustering

Use the k-means method.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase important steps when dealling with identify customer segments. 
In addition to some other files (images, excel) used to explain my decisions in notebook.
